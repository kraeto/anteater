<h2>Please feel free to utilize the resources in this website to learn more about Year Up, YUBA's Quality Assurance Track, or Quality Assurance in general.</h2>

<br />
<p>Year Up is a non-profit organization that provides a program for urban youth from low income backgrounds to gain access to opportunities to work in Fortune 500 tech companies.</p>
<p>Year Up Bay Area is a division of Year Up with locations in San Francisco and Silicon Valley. Some of YUBA's corporate partners include: Salesforce, LinkedIn, Airbnb, and Yelp.</p>

<br />
<p>Within Year Up's intense program, trainees gain college credit from courses such as Business Communication, Business Writing, Computer Science, Web Development, and Networking. These courses are learned through the <b>Learning and Development</b> Phase. Depending on the students' preference, they will then get placed into a specific track. The different tracks currently offered at Year Up for this cohort are: IT, CyberSecurity, Project Coordination, Quality Assurance, and Networking.</p>

<p>Students learn the hard skills needed for typical jobs within tech companies in the Learning and Development phase. However, this phase is broken up into three subphases, called Mods I, II, and III.</p>

<p>After the <b>L & D</b> Phase, students then transition into a six month internship with a company selected by Year Up's Internship Placement Team. After internship is completed, the Year Up student graduates!</p>

<ul>
	<li><b>Mod I</b>: This is the initial learning phase. During Mod I, students are divided into different Learning Communities, or LCs. Web Development and Hardware are taught during this phase.</li>
	<li><b>Mod II</b>: Students learn more about Networking and Operating Systems. During this phase, students also learn how to conduct informational interviews. At the end of Mod II, students prepare for a week of Internship Readiness Assessment, or IRA. This assessment determines whether students are ready for internship. Once the assessment is completed, students find out what track they are placed in for Mod III.</li>
	<li><b>Mod III</b>: This phase involves the specific concentration or track for each student. Below is what is covered for the Quality Assurance track, specifically.</li>
